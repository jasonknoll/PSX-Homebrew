## PsyQ/PsyQo

I'm brand new to homebrew game development, especially on PSX, so don't take everything I write here as fact.

As far as I can tell, `PsyQ` is the original set of C libraries given out to game developers for the Playstation way back in the 90s. (Before I was born!)
Original documentation is available (TODO add link) and is tremendously helpful. Some of these topics are quite complicated for a noob like myself.

`PsyQo` appears to be a new C++ alternative to PsyQ with more modern features. Not that I have the skills to take advantage of them yet, but it's nice to have a modernized option. 

Both PsyQ and PsyQo projects are build with the `PSX.DEV` VSCode extension, which provides libraries and build tools as well. 

TODO Create repo for indivudual projects
TODO add individual repos to projects folders as submodules
